## Why are these files so strange?

These files are generated by the [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) compiler. They are used to serialize and deserialize data in a language-agnostic way. This means that you can use the same data structure in multiple languages, and the data will be compatible.

## How can I edit these files?
1. Make a change to the [NookureStaff-Protobuf repository](https://github.com/Nookure/NookureStaff-Proto) in the file you want to edit and make a pull request or create your own fork.
2. Once the pull request is merged, you can update the submodule in this repository by running `git submodule update --remote`.
3. Download the latest protobuf compiler, you can download it from the [official releases](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v27.1) or
### Windows
```bash
# Winget
winget install --id=Google.Protobuf  -e

# Chocolatey
choco install protoc

# Scoop
scoop install protobuf
```

### MacOS
```bash
brew install protobuf
```

### Linux
```bash

sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
```

4. Run this command on a bash terminal to generate the new files, you need to be at the root of the project
```bash
./nook genProto
```
