## Main features of the plugin
Our plugin has an extensive list of features that can be chosen to be toggled on or off by the end user, but we always make every aspect configurable.

## Staff Mode
This mode restricts staff members from impacting the server state unless they have special permissions, while still granting them access to valuable moderation tools.

## User Notes
This module allows adding notes to users on the Minecraft server. These notes can be displayed when the user logs in. Additionally, admins can set notes to be visible only to other admins, allowing them to leave notes for other staff members as well.

## Vanish
The vanish state can be activated by staff members using a command or while in Staff Mode, rendering them invisible to regular players. This feature enables staff to spectate players discreetly, monitor for hacks, and ensure compliance with server rules.

## Freeze
This tool enables staff members to freeze players and display a message in the chat. It can be particularly useful when staff need to conduct a screenshare on a user to verify if they are cheating.

## **Staff Chat**
The Staff Chat feature provides a private communication channel for online staff members within the Minecraft server, allowing them to interact with each other discreetly without using the public chat.

## Multi Server
This plugin is not only capable of running on an independent Minecraft server but is also compatible with Proxy synchronization. This compatibility enables simultaneous usage across multiple servers, facilitating communication of certain plugin features between the backend servers.

## Multi Proxy
Nookure Staff is compatible with Proxy synchronization for multi-server use and seamlessly operates on multiple proxies with Redis integration. This allows efficient communication and synchronization of plugin functions across different proxy servers, enhancing scalability and performance in complex server setups.
